For questions 2-6, please type "True" or "False" in front of the question number.

True 2. My experiment shell can correctly load the Iris dataset:

True 3. My experiment shell randomizes the order of the instances (making sure to keep instances lined up with their appropriate targets) it and splits the data into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%)?

True 4. I have GaussianNB algorithm on the dataset and received results.

True 5. I have created a HardCoded classifier class with two methods: fit and predict. The fit method accepts training data (including targets). The predict method returns a prediction or classification for each instance it receives.

True 6. The Experiment Shell, processes the data, passes the training data to the classifierâ€™s train method, the test data to the predict method, and then compares the predicted values against the correct answers, to produce an overall accuracy (on the test set).

True 7. I have run the HardCoded classifier on the Iris dataset and obtained a result.

True 8. What accuracy do you get when running the HardCoded classifier on the Iris dataset and why do you think that is?
The most recent run returned 36.00%.  I think it is this accuracy because the dataset is randomized each time the program is run.  Since I am always returning
the same value (0) from my classifier, 36% of the time, it hits a 0 in the randomized dataset. 


9. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
1 - Some attempt was made
2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
-> 4 - Meets requirements
5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

10. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category:
I followed the instructions for the assignment to make the procedures of the program.  I finished it on Friday, and I intended to write above and beyond
code on Saturday, but I didn't get to doing it.  I looked up on the internet how to use the different sk_learn packages I used.  I collaborated with a fellow
student who helped me immensely understand the python language.  I am looking forward to learning more about python and Machine Learning.  By the end of the assignment,
I understood better how classifiers and models work, and how machine learning is about training the dataset.
